# 🚚 Logistics Delivery | Efficiency & Delay Analysis Dashboard  

This project showcases an **Excel dashboard** built to analyze logistics delivery data. It provides insights into regional revenue, fuel costs, delivery delays, route performance, and driver efficiency to support data-driven decision-making. 

---

## 📊 Project Objective  

To design a dynamic and interactive Excel dashboard that enables stakeholders to:  

- Track key KPIs: **Revenue, Fuel Cost, Average Delay, Delivery Success Rate, Customer Rating**  
- Compare **regional performance** and identify efficiency gaps  
- Analyze **routes, drivers, and dispatch trends**  
- Understand the impact of **priority level and field type** on revenue  
- Improve operational efficiency through data insights

## 📁 Dataset Overview  

The dataset includes logistics delivery records with the following key columns:  

- **Dispatch Date, Expected Arrival, Actual Arrival**  
- **Delivery ID, Route Code, Driver ID**  
- **Region, Priority Level, Field Type**  
- **Revenue, Fuel Cost, Delivery Delay (hrs)**  
- **Customer Rating, Delivery Status**

## 🛠️ Steps Covered  

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Removed duplicates, corrected data types, and handled missing values.  
   - Standardized columns for consistency.  

2. **Exploratory Analysis (Pivot Tables & Charts)**  
   - Revenue by region, driver, route, and priority.  
   - Dispatch and delay analysis.  

3. **Data Visualization (Charts & KPIs)**  
   - Regional revenue performance  
   - Route cost comparison  
   - Dispatch date trends  
   - Delivery delays  

4. **Dashboard Development**  
   - Built an **interactive Excel Dashboard**.  
   - Added slicers/filters for **region, route, and driver analysis**.

## 📊 Key KPIs  

- **Total Revenue:** $2,744,639  
- **Total Fuel Cost:** $422,286  
- **Average Delivery Delay:** 13.55 hours  
- **Delivery Success Rate:** 90% of orders delivered  
- **Average Customer Rating:** 4.25 / 5  

---

## 🔑 Insights  

- **South region** generates the **highest revenue** with **lower fuel cost** compared to East.  
- Routes **R6** and **R1** → highest revenue but also highest fuel costs.  
- Drivers **DRV15** and **DRV46** → top revenue contributors.  
- **Jan 18** → highest revenue day | **Feb 10** → lowest revenue day.  
- **High-priority** and **Heavy field type orders** → largest revenue share.  
- **Average delay = 13.55 hrs**, but **90% deliveries successful**, showing strong reliability.
